#### [Interacting Objects Sketch](https://dmecam.github.io/120-work/hw-12/)

# Homework week 12

During this week I learned how to do Interacting objects. Also, I started to separate the classes into different files in order to have a better organization.

## Process

In order to complete my assignment I took the following steps:

1. I read all the information about the process of the assignment. I saw all the videos and followed all the instructions.
2. I duplicated the empty-example directory and renamed it (hw-12).
3. I decided to create a new class `Point` and set all the properties and methods of that class.
4. I did an array to manage a large number of objects of the new class `Point`.
5. I wrote a method inside the `Point` class and I make it interactive.
6. I organized my folder and created a new file for the class.
7. I edited the index.html.

## Problems

This week I had a problem with a second class I created, this class was supposed to interact with the `Point` one but each time I called it, the screen was blank. I tried to fix it by using the error console and reading the class forum but I couldn't so I did changes in my main class and in the interactivity with the mouse. Additionally, I had minor problems, like a misspelling or a missing a symbol. So, I solved it opening the error console and checking the code a second time.

During this week I checked one of my classmate's code and fix it (there was a `{` missing). I tried to help with other issues but I didn't know the solution or the problems were already solved (I'm glad they found a solution).

I have been reading about Object Oriented Programming in order to learn more about it.

## Future Work

In the future, I will be able to work with OOP and use interactivity between objects without problems.

## Images

This is what my final sketch looked like.
