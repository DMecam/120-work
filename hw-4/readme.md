#### [Monster Portrait](https://dmecam.github.io/120-work/hw-4/)

# Homework week 4

During this week I created a Monster Portrait with p5. In order to commit it I learned how to use more functions like `arc()` (to create an arc) and `translate()` to move the grid. Also, I learned how to create and use a sandbox (with `push()` and `pop()`).

## Process

In order to complete my assignment I took the following steps:

1. I read all the information about the process of the assignment. I saw all the videos and followed all the instructions.
2. I duplicated the empty-example directory and renamed it (hw-4).
3. I decide to do the Moster Portrait because I thought I would have more possibilities choosing the shapes, the position of them and the colors.
3. I started creating the canvas and the base for the shape of the Monster with different functions.
4. I created a sandbox per each part of the portrait and I translated, rotated and scaled the grid in order to adjust each shape. Also, I decided to use the `noStroke()` function in the majority of the shapes.
5. Once I had the base I added the details (like the shadows in some of the shapes).

## Problems

This week I only had minor problems, like a misspelling or a missing a symbol. So, I solved it opening the error console and checking the code a second time. Also, I committed an error saving this readme; I saved it in another directory, but it is solved.

I wanted to help my classmates in the class repo issue tracker but the majority of the problems were already solved (I'm glad they found a solution) or I don't know how to solve them.

I have been reading the p5 reference page in order to learn more about each function and the radians. Also, I found really interesting the hexadecimal numbering.

## Images

This is what my final sketch looked like.
