# Homework week 11

During this week I learned how to do Object Oriented Programing and the use of `this.`.

## Process

In order to complete my assignment I took the following steps:

1. I read all the information about the process of the assignment. I saw all the videos and followed all the instructions.
2. I duplicated the empty-example directory and renamed it (hw-11).
3. I decided to create a new class `Car` and set all the properties and methods of that class.
4. I did an array to manage a large number of objects of the new class `Car`.

## Problems

This week I only had minor problems, like a misspelling or a missing a symbol. So, I solved it opening the error console and checking the code a second time.

I wanted to help my classmates in the class repo issue tracker but the majority of the problems were already solved (I'm glad they found a solution) or I didn't know how to solve them.

I have been reading about Object Oriented Programing in order to learn more about it.

## Future Work

In the future, I will be able to work with OOP and use arrays to manage the new objects without problems.

## Images

This is what my final sketch looked like.
