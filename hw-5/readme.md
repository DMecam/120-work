#### [Live "animation" Sketch](https://dmecam.github.io/120-work/hw-5/)

# Homework week 5

During this week I created an animation with p5. In order to commit it I learned how to use more functions like `mousePressed()`. Also, I learned how to store data, alter data and pass data around with variables (I used pre-defined variables as `windowWidth` and I defined my own variables). Additionally, I learned about the Scope, how to name a variable correctly and the frame rate.

## Process

In order to complete my assignment I took the following steps:

1. I read all the information about the process of the assignment. I saw all the videos and followed all the instructions.
2. I duplicated the empty-example directory and renamed it (hw-5).
3. I decided to create an abstract image that changes over time because I thought I would have more possibilities choosing the shapes, the position of them and the colors.
3. I started creating the canvas with `windowWidth` and `windowHeight`.
4. I created my own variables and defined them. Also, I decided to create the background in the `setup()` function. Additionally, I decided to include my Monster portrait (hw-4 sketch) because I practiced all the new functions and the variables on it.
5. Once I have the variables I started creating the shapes and the movement.
6. I created more variables in order to change the color. And I added several shapes controlled by the mouse.
7. Also, I removed the mouse and I added the `mousePressed` to reset the background.
8. Finally, I added text and I included the `frameCount` function.

## Problems

This week I only had minor problems, like a misspelling or a missing a symbol. So, I solved it opening the error console and checking the code a second time.

I posted a comment in the class repo issue tracker in order to help a classmate.

I have been reading the p5 reference page in order to learn more about each function (especially about `mousePressed`).

## Future Work

In the future, I will be able to control, declare and describe my own variables without problems in order to create better animations. In addition to this, I will become familiar with the pre-defined variables, the frames and with the `mousePressed` function.

## Images

This is what my final sketch looked like.
